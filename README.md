# automatic-levelup
A script to automatically focus into Discord, send random text, then minimize it to continue with what you're doing. 

Dependencies: xdotool

The code is still very specific for what I use it for, but this is how to change it:

Open PasswordGenerator.sh with your favourite text editor and change any instances of "#bot-spam - Discord" to what the title bar looks like when you open your own spam channel.
